#Data Cleaning Course Project

##Script Description
First, we read the required into objects in R.

Then we use rbind to combine the training and testing datasets

We then extract the columns that contain the words 'mean' or 'std'

After that, we convert the Activity numbers into their associated words

The variables are then given more descriptive names

The column names are the re-named to the more descriptive names of each variable
